      "Marco Sandoval, the Principal Consultant at DRMS is a highly experienced Risk Management professional with over 40 years of experience. His experience in both the private and public sectors proved to be of tremendous assistance to me during my tenure at Ingram Micro. Mr. Sandoval supported Ingram Micro’s Risk Management goals for over two years, specifically with the development of the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program and developing and implementing standard organizational insurance requirement templates. If there is any organization looking for the right expertise, they need to consider Mr. Sandoval’s services!",

He proved to be a key part of the contract review team. His analyses and recommendations were clear, concise and on point resulting in time saving and moving contract negotiations to resolution. Mr. Sandoval also conducted an introductory “Insurance 101 and Contract Review” training presentation for the Purchasing Department Team to assist them in recognizing the implications of key insurance and risk management terms in contracts.",

      "The services of DRMS were retained at a crucial time in the Risk Management Department during the absence of the Risk Manager who was called to active military duty. Specifically, the Principal Consultant, Marco Sandoval, was called upon to support the area of contract review and analysis, as well mentor onboarding risk management personnel. Mr. Sandoval’s breadth and depth of experience proved invaluable, particularly regarding the County’s general liability and professional liability insurance programs, and the accurate and timely submission of renewal applications and corresponding supporting documentation. Mr. Sandoval proved to be a key resource for new staff, particularly in the areas of workers’ compensation, loss prevention, contracts, and insurance. He was often available for staff both in person and virtually to ensure goals were met. In retrospect it is evident that without DRMS the County’s programs would have been compromised. The Principal Consultant, Marco Sandoval, is a trustworthy and hardworking risk management professional and the results of his efforts confirm this to be the case time and again. ",
